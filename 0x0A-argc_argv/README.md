C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games.

## Concepts

- __argc and argv__
- __how to compile with unused variables__

## Requirements

#### C

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- Files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Use `Betty` to check coding style. [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

#### Shell

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- The first line of all your files should be: `#!/bin/bash`
- Scripts should be two lines long: $ `wc -l <filename>`
- Scripts tested on: __Ubuntu 20.04 LTS__
