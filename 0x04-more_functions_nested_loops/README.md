## Requirements

#### C

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- Files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Use `Betty` to check coding style. [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

#### Shell

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- The first line of all your files should be: `#!/bin/bash`
- Scripts should be two lines long: $ `wc -l <filename>`
- Scripts tested on: __Ubuntu 20.04 LTS__
