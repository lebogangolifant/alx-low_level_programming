# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games.

## Concepts

- __Keywords and identifiers__
- __integers__
- __Arithmetic Operators in C__
- __If statements in C__
- __ifâ€¦else statement__
- __Relational operators__
- __Logical operators__
- __while loop in C__
- __While loop__

## Requirements

#### C

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- Files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Use `Betty` to check coding style. [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

#### Shell

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- The first line of all your files should be: `#!/bin/bash`
- Scripts should be two lines long: $ `wc -l <filename>`
- Scripts tested on: __Ubuntu 20.04 LTS__
