# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games.

## Concepts

- __C program Compilation Process__
- __Object-like Macros__
- __Macro Arguments__

## Requirements

#### C

- Editors: [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vi, vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- Files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Use `Betty` to check coding style. [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

## Project Tasks

| TASK FILE                      | DESCRIPTION      |
|  -----------                   |  -----------     |
|[0-object_like_macro.h]()|Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.|
|[1-pi.h]()|Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.|
|[2-main.c]()|Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.|
|[3-function_like_macro.h]()|Write a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.|
|[4-sum.h]()|Write a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.|
